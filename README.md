Scripts for BIORXIV/2022/500634 
You will find in this repository several scripts developed to perform the following analyses:
- gene-based permutation tests (C2_max and C2_mean gene-based statistics)
- autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation tests
- permutation tests to test for colocalisation of outlier genes with coldspots of recombination
- outlier gene clustering tests
